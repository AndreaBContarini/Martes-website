          "a": "Prisma isn't a new app to learn. It's WhatsApp, which your employees already use every day to message friends and family. They answer 4-5 questions in 30 seconds and they're done. Zero training needed, zero complications."
        },
        {
          "q": "How long does it take to get up and running?",
          "a": "24-48 hours. We configure the entire system on our end: WhatsApp and the entire infrastructure for the AI agent. You just need to send us the employee list. Zero installations on your part, zero training to organize. You're live in 2 days."
        },
        {
          "q": "€30 per month per employee seems expensive",
          "a": "With Prisma, you save an average of 15 hours per month per employee. At €25/hour (average cost of an employee in the construction, facility, and real estate sectors in Italy), that's €375 in savings. Prisma costs €30/month. You are gaining €345 net per month per employee. 12.5x ROI. It's an investment that pays for itself 12 times over."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if employees forget to reply to Prisma?",
          "a": "Prisma sends automatic reminders at the end of the day. If someone doesn't reply by the set time, they get a follow-up. You see immediately from the dashboard who is missing and can nudge them if necessary. The system is designed to minimize 'forgetfulness'."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does it only work on WhatsApp?",
          "a": "WhatsApp is the default because everyone uses it. But if your team communicates on other platforms, no problem: we have Prisma on Telegram, Slack, and Microsoft Teams too. You choose where you want it to work."
        },
        {
          "q": "Are our data safe? Who has access?",
          "a": "Only you and your authorized team. Data is end-to-end encrypted and saved on European servers (100% GDPR compliant). We at Martes AI maintain the technical infrastructure, but we never access your data without your explicit permission."
        },

        {
          "q": "Can we integrate Prisma with our management software?",
          "a": "Yes. Prisma automatically exports data to Excel/CSV which you can import into your management software. If you want a direct automatic integration with your specific software, that would be a custom integration. Let's evaluate it together on a call to understand feasibility and costs."
        },
        {
          "q": "My employees sometimes have a lot to tell, can Prisma handle long messages?",
          "a": "Absolutely yes. Prisma can analyze voice notes of even 5-6 minutes and multiple images in a single conversation. If an employee has had a complex day with multiple interventions or problems to report, they can send everything: Prisma automatically extracts all relevant information (hours, materials, problems, location) and organizes photos in the dashboard. The employee speaks naturally, Prisma does the rest."
        },
        {
          "q": "What happens if an employee sends wrong information?",
          "a": "Prisma saves the entire history: original voice notes, photos, timestamps. You can always trace back to the full conversation to verify. Additionally, HR can correct data from the dashboard at any time. You have total control and transparency."
        },
        {
          "q": "We already have an internal system, why should we change?",
          "a": "The question is: does your current system save you 15 hours a month per employee? Do your employees use it willingly or see it as a burden? If you are still chasing someone for reports, it means the system isn't working. Prisma is designed to be so simple that employees prefer using it rather than filling out sheets."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if we have employees working in areas without internet connection?",
          "a": "WhatsApp works even with limited data connection. The employee can send the report as soon as they get back into a covered area (even hours later). Prisma processes messages as soon as they arrive and updates the dashboard automatically. No data lost."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can Prisma manage multiple locations/sites/teams simultaneously?",
          "a": "Absolutely yes. Prisma is multi-tenant: you can have different locations, different teams, different projects, all managed by the same system. From the dashboard, you can filter by location, team, project, employee. Everything organized and under control in one place."
        },
        {
          "q": "Are reports customizable?",
          "a": "Yes. During setup, we configure together the questions Prisma should ask employees based on your sector and needs (hours, materials, client, intervention type, problems encountered, etc.). Automatic reports are also customizable: choose frequency (daily, weekly), format, and what to include."
        },
        {
          "q": "What happens if Prisma stops working?",
          "a": "Prisma is built on enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure with 99.9% uptime. In case of rare technical issues, you have priority support via WhatsApp with a response within 1 hour during business hours. Furthermore, all historical data remains always accessible from the dashboard even offline."
